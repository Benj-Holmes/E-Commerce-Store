# E-Commerce-Store
This is a Full-Stack application, using the PERN stack (Postgres, Express, Node, React), based on an ecommerce store, 
in which a user is able to select the products, and sort them how they like. They can add selected products to their
cart, which will be saved inbetween sessions if the user logs in. When they are finished they can pay via the checkout.
The user will also see previous purchases in the order history on their account details page.

## Project Description
I wanted this project to mimic a real life ecommerce store as much as possible, so i added a number of features such as
Google Authentication, Log in and Register pages, Stripe payment integration, and i am happy with the result.
The hardest part of this project was the authentication and having log ins persist through sessions.

can return to the homepage, access the products, their account, the checkout, or open their shopping cart. At all times they can see the quantity of 
items in their current shopping cart.
